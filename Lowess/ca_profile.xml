        Passionate DevOps engineer crafting Docker containers with a unique twist. My approach goes
        beyond conventional methods, focusing on lean containers with only essential dependencies.
        Each container dynamically fetches and updates the application upon start/restart, ensuring
        seamless operation. Join me in redefining the Unraid experience, one container at a time.
